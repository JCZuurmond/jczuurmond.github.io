# Cor's blog

This is my [blog](https://jczuurmond.github.io/), which is based on the Jekyll
theme [Huxpro](https://github.com/lynn9388/huxpro) used by
[Lynn9388](https://github.com/lynn9388/lynn9388.github.io)

# Local development

Use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) as Ruby environment manager. Then:

``` sh
$ gem install jekyll bundler
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The PyData site is developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator in Ruby. It's adivsable to use some kind of environment manager like `rbenv` before installing jekyll. After installing `gem install jekyll bundler`, you can run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
