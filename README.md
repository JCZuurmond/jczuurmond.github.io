# Cor's blog

This repository is used to build [jczuurmond.github.io](jczuurmond.github.io).

## Install

The site is developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site
generator in Ruby. It's adivsable to use some kind of environment manager like
`rbenv` before installing jekyll. After installing `gem install jekyll
bundler`, you can run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Copy

The blog is created with [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). They
explain how to do this yourself.
