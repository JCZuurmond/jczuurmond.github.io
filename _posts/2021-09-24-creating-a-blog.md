title: Creating a blog
tags: [Jekyll]
---

Today I created a blog using [Gihub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

# Set-up

Github pages has a 
[step by step guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
on setting up Github pages with Jekyll.

# Theme

The acknowledgments go to 
[lynn9388's huxpro theme](https://github.com/lynn9388/huxpro) which is based on the 
[Huxpro theme](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io). Seeing the set-up
of [lynn9388's Github pages](https://github.com/lynn9388/lynn9388.github.io) it
is very easy to start using this theme yourself!
