Hi there! :wave: My name is Cor!

In this blog I talk about various data tools that hopefully make your life
easier.

I got involved with the data space in 2014 when I worked with satellite radar
imagery at [SkyGeo](https://skygeo..com){:target="_blank"}.  Today, I am
demystifying data at [GoDataDriven](https://godatadriven.com). I have a
scientific background in data science and artificial intelligence, and I am an
engineer at heart.

> You can always talk to me about simple solutions that solve complex problems.
