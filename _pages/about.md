Hi there! My name is Cor.

In this blog I talk about various data tools that hopefully make your life
easier. I am keen on simple solutions that solve complex problems. I aim to make
things easy, to make data products less mysterious. I have a scientific
background in data science and artificial intelligence, but am an engineer at
heart.

Besides this blog, I
- work as Data Engineer at
  [GoDataDriven](https://godatadriven.com/){:target="_blank"}
- give training in data science at
  [GoDataDriven](https://godatadriven.com/){:target="_blank"}
- am a [PyData Amsterdam](https://amsterdam.pydata.org/){:target="_blank"}
  committee member. We organize
  [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-NL/){:target="_blank"} about Python
  and data.
- develop the open source data quality tool:
